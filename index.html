After making her debut in Telugu cinema with the psychological thriller 1: Nenokkadine (2014), Sanon won the Filmfare Award for Best Female Debut for her performance in Sabbir Khan's action-comedy Heropanti (2014), which marked her first project in Hindi cinema.</h4>

                    <p class="p_modal">In 2014, Sanon debuted into acting in Sukumar's Telugu psychological thriller 1: Nenokkadine as a journalist who is the love interest of Mahesh Babu's character Gautham.[10][11][12] The film received mixed reviews from critics.[13][14] A reviewer for The Times of India wrote that Sanon "looks pretty" and "acts well".[15] while a reviewer for Sify.com stated that she "looks gorgeous" and considered her performance to be "okay" for a newcomer.[16]

                        Later that year, Sanon entered Hindi cinema through Sabbir Khan's action romance Heropanti with debutante Tiger Shroff.[17][18][19] The film had a mixed reception, but nevertheless was a surprising success earning ₹726 million (US$10 million) worldwide.[20] Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama wrote that she "looks gorgeous and handles her part with certainty and confidence" and that she "has the trappings of a star",[21] whereas Rajeev Masand said she "looks lovely and makes an impression despite her harebrained role".[22] Conversely, Srijana Das of The Times of India criticised her emoting, calling it "more cheesy than sharp."[23] For Heropanti, Sanon won the Filmfare Best Female Debut Award.[24]

                        Sanon began 2015 by featuring in her second Telugu movie, Sudheer Varma's crime drama Dohchay co-starring Naga Chaitanya.[25] She was next cast in Rohit Shetty's comical action romance Dilwale with Varun Dhawan, Shah Rukh Khan and Kajol which broke several box office records to become one of the highest-grossing Indian films of all time, grossing more than ₹3.72 billion (US$52 million) worldwide.[26][27] Anupama Chopra disliked the film and wrote that Sanon and Dhawan "work as bait, meant to bring in the critical youth segment".<br>

                    <p class="p_modal">Hooda made his Hindi film debut with Mira Nair's Monsoon Wedding (2001). However, little recognition came his way and he went on to appear in a spate of critically and commercially unsuccessful projects including D (2005) and Karma Aur Holi (2009). A turning point in his career came when Hooda starred in the commercially successful Once Upon a Time in Mumbaai (2010), and was subsequently noted for his performance in Saheb, Biwi Aur Gangster (2011), which earned him an IIFA Award for Best Supporting Actor nomination. His starring roles in thrillers Jannat 2 (2012) and Jism 2 (2012) sustained him success at the box-office as he continued to garner praise for his performances in such films as the road drama Highway (2014) and the biopics Rang Rasiya (2014) and Sarbjit (2016).

                        In addition to his film career, Hooda has acted in numerous stage plays and had made his debut as a playwright with an adaptation of Lee Blessing's A Walk in the Woods. He is also a professional equestrian who regularly participates in polo, show jumping and dressage events. He won a silver medal at an open dressage event in New Delhi that was organised by the Equestrian Federation of India.<br>
